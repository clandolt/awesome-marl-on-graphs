## What is MARL on Graphs?

Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) involves multiple agents interacting within an environment, with the goal of learning optimal policies through trial and error. In graph-based environments, these agents are typically represented as nodes in a graph, with edges defining relationships or interactions between agents. This setup allows for a diverse range of applications, from social network analysis to decentralized decision-making in robotics and smart grids.

## Who is this for?

- Researchers and practitioners interested in **multi-agent systems** and **reinforcement learning**.
- Developers looking for resources to **implement MARL algorithms** in graph-based environments.
- Students seeking a comprehensive introduction to the **intersection of MARL and graph theory**.
